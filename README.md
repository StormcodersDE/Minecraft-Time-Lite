# Minecraft-Time-Lite
This is the Lite-Edition of Minecraft: Time. This Modpack required 4GB RAM.

Generally speaking, Minecraft Time is a highly tech-based modpack. Hundreds of modifications are only waiting to be explored by players. Discover the possibilities of popular mods, from Extreme Reactors to Draconic Evolution! Not your cup of tea? Then maybe you're in the mood for your own storyline! With Custom NPCs you can create your own fractions with your very own quests.

This pack is based on the highly successful (German) Minecraft project After Humans, which was only available for version 1.7.10. It was set in a post-apocalyptic world with humanity trying to recover from a global catastrophe. The updated Minecraft Time offers you full 1.12 performance combined with an outstanding collection of mods. 

So that even players with a weak computer setup can enjoy the Minecraft Time Modpack, this light pack was created. It can not be driven with trains, but with small cute cars. Also there will be no journey to the moon!
